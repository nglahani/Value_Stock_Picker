# PythStocks

Feel Free to Take a look around at my StockPicker, which I made in python! Take a look at the code, contained in the PythonStockAll.py file, and it's corresponding results found in the StockPicker.xlsx file. 

The overall goal of this project was to develop code that reads in stock market data sets to analyze stock values and return a ranked list of the SP500. Founded on fundamental and technical analysis of each stock with an emphasis on long-term investing techniques. 

This is a value based investing tool, meaning each stock was scored based on with the following criteria: Pietroski Score, Dividends Per Share, Price-to-Book Ratio, Current Ratio, Price-to-Earnings Ratio, and Graham Number.

The top 10 stocks selected by this script outperformed the general SP500 by 12% for FY 2020.
